# The Backstory
I ([@Shpigford](https://twitter.com/Shpigford)) started [Baremetrics](https://baremetrics.com) in 2013 on a whim to scratch an itch I had to get SaaS analytics from my Stripe account for a previous business. I threw together this code over the course of a few weeks and put it out there to see what would happen.

Long story short, it worked a lot better than I ever could have imagined. We're now a team of 10 doing [~$1.5M in revenue](https://demo.baremetrics.com) and serving nearly 1,000 businesses with an incredibly powerful suite of business insight tools.

We no longer use anything from this initial version I built, but we've decided to publish here to show how little you need to get started building a business.

From a code-quality standpoint, this stuff is terrible. ðŸ™ƒ But the reality is, the quality of code doesn't matter when you're just trying to prove an idea. Once I proved the idea, I promptly hired engineers who actually knew what they were doing. ðŸŽ‰

If you're an engineer trying figure out what to build or how to build it, I encourage you to just ship _something_. Don't get caught up in having "perfect" code. Just get your product out there and start getting real feedback from real customers.
